### Solved by bitvijays

In the excercise, you are given a PDF, but important information is hidden somehow.
>You found a letter that may shed light on recent events.

To solve this, we opened the file in <a href="http://www.rttsoftware.com/">PDF Explorer</a> and Extract the Images. 

PDF Original:
{% img center /images/2014/pico/redacted/red1.png %}

Image Extracted:
{% img center /images/2014/pico/redacted/red2.png %}

The flag is **one_two_three_four**.
