### Solved by historypeats

For this challenge we're given the source code and the name of the student "Richard Stallman". The problem is getting his Access Key. If we look at the code, Access Keys are generated by hashing the student's name with MD5.
This can be seen in the code below:
```python
 grades[max(grades.keys())+1] = {"name": name, "accesskey": hashlib.md5(name).hexdigest(), "grades": usergrades}

```

So all we need to do is MD5 "Richard Stallman" and we get:
```python
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.md5("Richard Stallman").hexdigest()
'956ae5688879015fa8a3f06b0056c10e'
```
All that is left is to login and view grades:
```bash
command: login 956ae5688879015fa8a3f06b0056c10e
Login successful. Now logged in as "Richard Stallman". For help run "help".
