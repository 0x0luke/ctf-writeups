Our resident ROP ninja [barrebas](https://twitter.com/barrebas) recently gave the team a bootcamp on Return Oriented Programming. The presentation was followed by a demo walkthrough on writing a ROP exploit on a vulnerable application. Since the presentation was well received, he's decided to make the slides available to everyone. You can view them at [https://speakerdeck.com/barrebas/rop-primer](https://speakerdeck.com/barrebas/rop-primer). We hope you enjoy it!
